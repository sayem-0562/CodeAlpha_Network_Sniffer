# CodeAlpha_Network_Sniffer
The Network Sniffer is a Windows application designed to capture and analyze network packets in real time. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to start and stop packet sniffing with ease. The application leverages Scapy, a powerful Python library for network packet manipulation, to monitor network traffic on the selected network interface.

How It Works
>The user launches the application by double-clicking on "sniffer.py".

>Clicking the "Start Sniffing" button begins packet capture on the default network interface.

>Captured packets are displayed in a scrollable text area.

>Clicking "Stop Sniffing" stops packet capture.
